Project Name: Night in New York 

Project Description: Our program will generate an itinerary for users looking to explore New York
City based on their food preferences and activity preferences. After selecting what type of cuisine
they enjoy (Thai, Mexican, [blah blah blah]) and what activities they like (Arcade, Karaoke,
[blah blah blah]), our program scrapes Yelp to search for the Web's top two recommended venues for
each cuisine and each activity. We then use Dijkstra's Algorithm to return the shortest possible
route going through these venues. We present these results to our user, crafting their perfect
itinerary for a night in New York!

Categories: 
	1. Graph and graph algorithms: [Scott]

	2. Document Search (aka Information Retrieval): We used JSoup to scrape Yelp in order to
	retrieve the addresses, latitude/longitude coordinates, and names of the top recommended
	venues on Yelp.
	Assumptions: We assume that Yelp won't change the layout of their HTML tags in future website
	updates. Specifically, we assume that the second address tag will always contain the street
	address of the top Yelp recommendation; the third address tag will always contain the street
	address of the second best Yelp recommendation; the sibling element of the address tag will
	always contain the area/county name; the name of the venue will always be in the previous
	sibling element of the grand parent of the address tag.

Work Breakdown: 
- Scott: Graph Algorithms and Implementing Dijkstra's 
- Joseph: GUI and getting the coordinates, API Integration
- Daniel: Jsoup to scrape Yelp for relevant information
